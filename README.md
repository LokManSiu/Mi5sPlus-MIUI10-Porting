# Mi5sPlus-MIUI10-Porting
A magisk module enabling you to use MIUI10(Oreo-based) on Mi 5s Plus.


See [here](./magisk_module/README.md) for the modules's information.

Note:You can replace the [logo.img](./logo.img) provided (taken from MIUI official ROM) to make logo normally displayed while booting.

On Jul. 2 MIUI relesed a alpha version MIUI 10 8.7.2 for Mi 5s Plus, which, to our disappointment, is still based on Nougat 7.0.

However, from day when Mi Mix got its first MIUI 10 ROM(Oreo-based), someone found that it also works on Mi 5s Plus (they share a common SoC msm8996pro), so I made this module and try to fix bugs.There are still some  bugs (Color settings and Reading mode is unavailable), I hope someone can fix it.

For Mi 5s,it shares the same SoC with Mi Note 2. So similar way to make MIUI10 works on Mi 5s does exist.
